# minesweeper
Instructions
- enter "hidden mode" or "visible mode" to activate the mode
- enter "location" or "mine" to choose a spot
- enter a number from 0-99 to choose a spot
- enter "yes" or "no" if you think you found all of the mines (there are 10)
- repeat steps 2-4 until the game is won or lost
- if you guess a regular spot and it's a bomb, the game ends, you lose, and a new board is created to start over

In terms of bugs, in hidden mode, instead of displaying the number, it'll just replace it with R. Also, if you hit a mine and the game ends, the board doesn't clear in hidden mode.
